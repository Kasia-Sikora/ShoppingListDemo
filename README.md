<h1> FOODSTUFF </h1>

The foodstuff project was created to learn spring and angular.
The main assumptions were to create a set of personal recipes, from which you can then easily and quickly generate a shopping list. The project is still being developed and improved.

Frontend (Angular) of my implementation is also available at this link: <a href src="https://github.com/Kasia-Sikora/ShoppingListDemo-UI">Foodstuff Frontend</a>
